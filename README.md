# moya-generator-example
Example project for [moya-generator](https://github.com/frkncngz/moya-generator)

There are two providers and models in this example project, `WavesRPC` and `RippleRPC`. Since `RippleRPC` has custom code in it (and the `custom` flag true), it is committed to the repository. `WavesRPC` and `WavesRPCModels` will be generated when you first build the project (after `pod install`).
